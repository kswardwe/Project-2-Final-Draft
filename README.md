Question: Are the hemagluttin from the two H3N2 strain,(A/Florida/47/2016(H3N2)) and (A/Tennessee/34/2016(H3N2)) in 2016 more similar to that of the 1968 H3N2 pandemic,(A/Hong Kong/1/1968(H3N2)), or the strain (A/sweden/2004)?

Hypothesis: If the hemagluttins of different H3N2 human infecting strains are compared to each other, then both H3N2strains,A/Tennessee/34/2016 and A/Florida/47/2016, will have a higher protein sequence similarity to the H3N2 strain in 2014(A/sweden/2004), which would support the pattern of the H3N2 strains decreased virus avidity?
